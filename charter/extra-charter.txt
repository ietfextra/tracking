The IETF maintains several key email related protocols that relate to
message delivery to mailstores and mailstore access.  These include
the following:

 IMAP (RFC3501)
 SIEVE (RFC5228)
 ManageSieve (RFC5804)

From time to time, there are bursts of work to do and the motivation and
critical mass to do it.  When such bursts coincide, it's important to
give them a home.  This working group provides such a venue.

The WG will work on updates, extensions, and revisions to the above
email protocols. Upon formation, the working group will consider any
existing Internet Drafts that could be appropriate for its processing.
While an interest poll for a new related idea is fine, the WG should
avoid detailed discussion of work items lacking an Internet-Draft.

The working group will start with processing the backlog of IMAP/Sieve
extensions. Once this is done it will continue processing submitted
IMAP/Sieve extensions, as well as work on a revision of IMAP (RFC 3501).
Work on updating this RFC will include appropriate corrections,
clarifications, or amplifications to reflect existing practice or
to address problems that have been identified through experience with
IMAP as currently specified.  Also eligible for consideration is
the incorporation of accumulated errata or consolidation with newer documents
that have updated and/or extended the base specification. However,
any new functionality is expected to be pursued via
extensions rather than changes to the base protocol wherever possible.

If there is interest in revising SIEVE (RFC5228) and ManageSieve
(RFC5804), the WG will recharter.

Expressly excluded from this charter is work on any protocol for which a
dedicated working group already exists, such as DMARC, DCRUP or JMAP, as well
as any work on POP3, SMTP/LMTP and email format/MIME. However, each working group
should endeavor to remain aware of the activities of the other and collaborate
as needed.
