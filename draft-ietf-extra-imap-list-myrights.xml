      <t>This document defines an extension to the to IMAP LIST

    <section title='Introduction'>
      <t>IMAP clients typically fetch the set of rights granted on
      mailboxes so they can expose the allowed functionality to the
      logged-in user.  In order to do that, the client is 
      forced to issue a LIST or LSUB command to list all available
      mailboxes, followed by a MYRIGHTS command for each mailbox
      found.  This document defines an extension to the to IMAP LIST
      command that is identified by the capability string
      "LIST-MYRIGHTS".  The LIST-MYRIGHTS extension allows the client
      to request the set of rights that the logged-in user has been
      granted on mailboxes, along with other information typically
      returned by the LIST command.</t>
    </section>

    <section title='Conventions Used in This Document'>
      <t>In examples, "C:" indicates lines sent by a client that is connected
      to a server.  "S:" indicates lines sent by the server to the
      client.</t>

      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
      NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED",
      "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as
      described in <xref target='RFC2119' />.</t>

    </section>  <!-- Intro -->
    
    <section title='MYRIGHTS Return Option to LIST Command'
             anchor="myrights">
      <t><xref target='RFC4314'/> defines the MYRIGHTS command which is
      used by an IMAP client to determine the set of rights that the
      logged-in user has been granted on a given mailbox.  Frequently,
      a client will have to look up the rights for some or all of
      the mailboxes returned by the LIST command.  Doing so in
      multiple MYRIGHTS commands wastes bandwidth and can degrade
      performance if the client does not pipeline the requests.</t>

      <t>This document extends the LIST command with a new return option,
      "MYRIGHTS", which allows the client to request all of the
      desired information in a single command.  For each listable
      mailbox matching the list pattern and selection options, the
      server MUST return an untagged LIST response followed by an
      untagged MYRIGHTS response containing the set of rights granted
      to the logged-in user.</t>

      <t>If the server is unable to look up the set of rights for a
      given mailbox, it MAY drop the corresponding MYRIGHTS reply.  In
      such a situation, the LIST command would still return a tagged
      OK reply.</t>
    </section>  <!-- MYRIGHTS -->

    <section title='Examples'>

      <figure>
	<preamble>
	  In this example the "bar" mailbox doesn't exist, so it has
          no MYRIGHTS reply.
	</preamble>
        <artwork><![CDATA[
C: A01 LIST "" % RETURN (MYRIGHTS)
S: * LIST () "." "INBOX"
S: * MYRIGHTS "INBOX" lrswipkxtecda
S: * LIST () "." "foo"
S: * MYRIGHTS "foo" lrs
S: * LIST (\NonExistent) "." "bar"
S: A01 OK List completed.
]]></artwork>
      </figure>

      <figure>
	<preamble>
	  In this example the LIST reply for the "foo" mailbox is
          returned because it has matching children, but no MYRIGHTS
          reply is returned because "foo" itself doesn't match the
          selection criteria.
	</preamble>
        <artwork><![CDATA[
C: A02 LIST (SUBSCRIBED RECURSIVEMATCH) "" % RETURN (MYRIGHTS)
S: * LIST (\Subscribed) "." "INBOX"
S: * MYRIGHTS "INBOX" lrswipkxtecda
S: * LIST () "." "foo" (CHILDINFO ("SUBSCRIBED"))
S: A02 OK List completed.
